# that to a Shapefile of 'densified' lines that will 
# enable us to show great circle lines between every
# pair of institutions. In an ideal world we'd talk 
# directly to Google, but the gspread library doesn't seem
# to offer any kind of straightforward pandas integration.
#
# In the script, we are looking for is a way to take 
# a text label for location and to obtain coordinates 
# for it using Wikipedia.
#
# Once we have a coordinate pair (technically, *if* we 
# have a coordinate pair) for an institution and
# a partner then we try to draw a great circle
# route between the two. The line is broken into  
# multiline segments that ensure it won't get re-drawn
# as a straight line in a projection.
